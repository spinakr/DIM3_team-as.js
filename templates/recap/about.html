    <h1>About</h1>

<h2>ReCap</h2>
<p> ReCap is a synergetic tool that allows developers(and not only) to organise their projects into boards. 
    Crea1ng	the	speciÔ¨Åca1ons list and capturing the	requirements of	a system is	a collaborative and ongoing
    process. The aim of this application is to help collect these requirements and specifications in a simple
    manner, similar to a collaborative TODO list. 
</p>


<h2>Developer Page</h2>
<p> On the developer page, users can see the projects they are currently engaged in, and also add new ones. Each project 
    has a name, a description and a number of members that participate in it.
</p>


<h2>Project Page</h2>
<p> The project page, designed to look like a board, contains the requirements, which are grouped based on
    the MoSCoW method (must have/should have/could have/would have). When adding a requirement, the user must 
    specify a name(which will appear in the list), a description(optional), a category, and a responsible person(optional).
    Each requirement has its own unique id, which is generated automatically and is formed by the first 3 letters of the 
    project name and a number (which represents the number of the requirement in the order it was added).
    Users can assign these requirements to other project members, or to themselves, and make use
    of the drag-and-drop functionality to move them to a different category.The MoSCoW lists of requirements can also 
    be collapsed so that the developer can choose which ones to display fully, hence allowing him to focus on certain 
    categories (for instance, only see the ones that are must haves). Users also have the possibility of editing the project
    (for instance, changing its name, etc.).
